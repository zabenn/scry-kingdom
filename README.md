# Scry Kingdom

A Firefox/Chrome extension that adds [Card Kingdom](https://www.cardkingdom.com) purchase buttons to [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com) card pages.

## Features

- Adds "Buy on Card Kingdom" buttons to the stores section on Scryfall card pages.
- Shows Card Kingdom prices for both regular and foil versions.
- Displays Card Kingdom prices inline on Scryfall card pages.

## Limitations

- Only finds a direct link and price for about 70% of cards.
- If the direct link cannot be found, links to a search on Card Kingdom.
- Doesn't yet work well for basic lands or token cards.
- The incomplete list of conversions from set codes is the main source of missing links.
